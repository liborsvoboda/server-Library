### API documentation
- [image-js 0.35.5 | Documentation](https://image-js.github.io/image-js/)


### Notes
- - for `toDataURL()`, `{ useCanvas: true }` is used for greater compression since it is intended for web
- image-js is improving - in `resize`, "bilinear" is apparently better than "nearestNeighbor", but not yet supported
